# Code of Conduct

We want 3DCF spaces (issues, pull requests, chats, events) to remain professional, welcoming, and productive.

## Expectations

- Treat everyone with respect; focus on technical content rather than the person.
- Welcome differing viewpoints and offer constructive feedback.
- Assume good intent, own mistakes, and apologize when needed.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in any project channel:

- Harassment, threats, or personal attacks of any kind.
- Discriminatory language or imagery, including slurs or stereotyping.
- Publishing private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
- Spam, trolling, or other conduct that disrupts collaboration.

## Scope

This policy applies to all project spaces and to anyone representing 3DCF in public (for example when using project-branded accounts or speaking at events on our behalf).

## Reporting & Enforcement

- Report incidents privately to [yevhenii@3dcf.dev](mailto:yevhenii@3dcf.dev). Reports are reviewed as quickly as possible and handled confidentially.
- Maintainers may edit or remove contributions, issue warnings, or ban participants (temporarily or permanently) when behavior violates this code.
