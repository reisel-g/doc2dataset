# Security Policy

The 3DCF team maintains one supported branch and handles vulnerability reports privately to keep downstream users safe.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main`  | ✅ |
| Tags prior to `v0.1.0` | ❌ |

## Reporting

- Email [yevhenii@3dcf.dev](mailto:yevhenii@3dcf.dev) with a short description, affected commit/release, and proof-of-concept or reproduction notes.
- If you prefer, request our PGP fingerprint in the same message and resend an encrypted copy.
- We acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and send a mitigation or fix plan within **15 business days** whenever possible.
- After a fix is released we will coordinate public disclosure and, if desired, credit the reporter.

Please avoid filing public issues or sharing exploit details until we confirm a fix is available and both parties agree on a disclosure date.
